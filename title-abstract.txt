Title:
A Tree-Based Model for Activity Based Travel Models and Feature Selection

Abstract:
In a previous study, Deloitte Consulting LLP developed a method of creating city simulations through cellular location and geospatial data. Using these simulations of human activity and traffic patterns, better decisions can be made regarding modes of transportation or road construction. However, the current commonly used method of estimating transportation mode choice is a utility model that involves many features and coefficients that may not necessarily be important but still make the model more complex. Instead, we used a tree-based approach - in particular, XGBoost - to identify just the features that are important for determining mode choice so that we can create a model that is simpler, robust, and easily deployable, in addition to performing better than the original utility model on both the full dataset and population subsets.
